Comprehensive Overview: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Software Development Practices Revision

What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured, step-by-step process that guides developers in creating, maintaining, and retiring software systems efficiently and effectively.

Goals of SDLC:
- Deliver high-quality software that meets user expectations
- Complete projects within deadlines
- Maintain development cost control
- Apply a systematic development approach

Phases of the SDLC

1. Planning and Requirement Analysis:
- Conduct stakeholder interviews and surveys
- Identify functional (what system does) and non-functional (how well system performs) requirements
- Document requirements clearly

2. System Design:
- Define architecture and technical structure
- Create design specifications, UI mockups, and prototypes
- Establish hardware/software needs

3. Implementation (Coding):
- Developers begin actual programming
- Use modular coding and version control tools (e.g., Git)
- Follow coding standards and testing best practices

4. Testing:
- Verify that the system meets requirements
- Levels of testing: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance

5. Deployment & Maintenance:
- Release product to production
- Gather user feedback (UAT)
- Apply updates, patches, and performance monitoring
- Fix issues as they arise

SDLC Models Comparison

Waterfall Model:
- Sequential and linear. Each stage must be completed before the next begins.
Pros: Simple, suitable for small projects, clear documentation
Cons: Inflexible to changes, late working product, not ideal for complex needs

Agile Model:
- Iterative and incremental. Promotes adaptability and frequent customer feedback.
Key Features: Sprints, working software delivery, team-customer collaboration
Pros: Flexible, customer involvement, low late-stage risk
Cons: Requires experience, hard to predict end product, minimal documentation

DevOps Model:
- Blends development and operations for rapid, reliable delivery.
Core Concepts: CI/CD, automated testing/deployment, built-in monitoring
Pros: Frequent updates, early issue detection, team collaboration
Cons: High learning curve, complex tool setup, cultural shift required

SDLC Model Comparison Overview

Factor               | Waterfall | Agile  | DevOps
---------------------|-----------|--------|--------
Approach             | Linear    | Iterative | Integrated
Flexibility          | Low       | High   | Medium
Customer Involvement | Low       | High   | High
Documentation        | Extensive | Lightweight | As needed
Testing              | Final     | Ongoing | Automated
Best For             | Stable    | Evolving | Frequent Deployment

Tools by SDLC Model

Waterfall Tools:
- MS Project (Planning)
- IBM Rational DOORS (Requirements)
- Enterprise Architect (Design)

Agile Tools:
- Jira, Trello (Planning)
- Selenium (Testing)
- Jenkins (CI/CD)

DevOps Tools:
- Docker, Kubernetes (Deployment)
- Ansible (Configuration)
- Prometheus (Monitoring)
- Git (Version Control)

Conclusion

SDLC models guide software teams in choosing the best strategy for developing and delivering software. There is no one-size-fits-all — the right model depends on:

- Project scope and complexity
- Flexibility of requirements
- Customer collaboration level
- Team structure and skills

Waterfall is great for structured, predictable projects
Agile fits dynamic, fast-paced environments
DevOps empowers rapid delivery and operations integration

Modern teams often blend multiple models to suit their needs — hybrid models are increasingly common.
