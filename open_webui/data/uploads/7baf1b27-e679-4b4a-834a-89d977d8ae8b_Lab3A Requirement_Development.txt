Lab 3A: Requirement Development
Software Development Practices – Requirements Engineering

Objective

In this lab, you will learn to identify and apply the four main activities of requirement development:

- Requirement Gathering
- Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Specification
- Requirement Verification

These concepts will be applied to real-world scenarios to reinforce understanding.

Introduction to Requirements Engineering

Requirements Engineering is the process of establishing and managing what a system should do. It is a core discipline in software development that helps define clear, unambiguous, testable requirements.

Why Is It Important?

Poorly defined requirements lead to:
- Miscommunication with clients
- Incomplete or faulty system functions
- Costly fixes during later stages

To prevent this, requirement development follows a systematic process:

The Four Key Activities of Requirement Development

1. Requirement Gathering:
Collecting raw data or inputs from stakeholders or sources like interviews, surveys, or observation.

2. Requirement Analysis:
Interpreting and organizing gathered information; identifying conflicts or redundancies.

3. Requirement Specification:
Clearly documenting agreed-upon requirements in a structured format.

4. Requirement Verification:
Ensuring that the documented requirements are complete, consistent, and meet stakeholder expectations.

Scenario-Based Activity: Identify the Requirement Activity

a. Charles is crafting an online survey to collect user feedback on application features.
→ Requirement Gathering

b. Mark is preparing a formal document listing all the features identified from surveys.
→ Requirement Specification

c. Stephen found an incomplete requirement statement and raised a concern.
→ Requirement Verification

d. Lionel is separating security requirements from performance requirements.
→ Requirement Analysis

e. Clare is observing the client's business processes to collect typical user needs.
→ Requirement Gathering

f. Leo is checking that all requirements collected are clear and unambiguous.
→ Requirement Specification

g. Philip is conducting a meeting with stakeholders to record their needs.
→ Requirement Gathering

h. Jerome is distributing questionnaires to stakeholders.
→ Requirement Gathering

Summary

- Requirement Gathering: Involves collecting needs via questionnaires, surveys, or interviews.
- Requirement Analysis: Focuses on interpreting, categorizing, and resolving conflicts in collected data.
- Requirement Specification: Involves writing down the requirements clearly and completely.
- Requirement Verification: Confirms that the requirements are correct, complete, and traceable.
